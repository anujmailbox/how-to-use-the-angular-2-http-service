# [How to Use the Angular 2 HTTP Service][published url]
## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]

If you are building an Angular 2 app, there will come a time when you need external data. The way to make this happen is through the HTTP service. HTTP allows you to make requests against remote endpoints and parse this data into a usable format.

The HTTP service has changed a lot since Angular 1. The main difference is the fact that information returned from HTTP is in the form of an Observable. As a result, we need to use special operators to handle the response. Follow along in this Coffee Break Course as instructor Reggie Dawson shows you the ins and outs of HTTP with Angular 2.

## Source Files Description

This repository contains the completed source code for the course project - a simple client implementation that uses the Angular 2 HTTP service.

# Build Instructions

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.21.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
